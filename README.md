# TicTacToe
Do you remember drawing a 3 by 3 grid, and racing with your friend to fill in the grid with X's and O's? <br>
I'm sure it would be a pretty interesting and nostalgic experience, reminiscing those days. <br>
Well, don't be disparaged, here we are with the Original Tic-Tac-Toe game, written completely in Vanilla C.
